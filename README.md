# do-you-know-me-discord-bot
A bot to interview new joiners and decide what roles they should get

## original brief

- Guest
-- click -> add the guest role to the user

- I know You
-- open a modal
--- IRL name question
--- a sentence about how you know this person

-- send { irlName, howYouKnowMe } to private channel as an embed with a red? color, include user ID in text output, add accept/deny buttons


-- assign guest role to user


-- if you click accept
--- modal to choose their role they get
--- assign the role to the user
--- edit the original text to say complete
--- change embed color to green (assuming that's possible, I've never tried to change an embed's color)

--- bot DMs the user that they've been accepted

-- if you click deny
--- modal to type a custom response (or leave blank for default response)
--- bot DMs the user that they've been denied (with custom response)
